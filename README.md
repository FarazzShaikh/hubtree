<h1 align="center">ðŸŒ´ hubtree</h1>
<p align="center"> A chrome extension to view the directory tree of a github repository. </p>

###Motivation:
Seeing directory structure:
- Better learning and understanding

### Installation Options:
1) **Chrome Webstore:** COMING SOON
2) **Manual Install:**
    -  Download/Clone the project
    - In your chrome address bar type: chrome://extensions
    - In the upper left turn on Developer Mode
    - Click load unpacked in the upper right corner
    - Select the hubtree folder that is contained **within** the project directory

###Development
```
npm install 
```
When done making changes:
```
npm run build
```
Then load to chrome in developer mode or reload the extension if it has already been loaded in chrome.
